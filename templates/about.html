            Hi, my name is Kimberly Pecco. I am passionate about technology, coding, and web development. 
            Currently, I am learning Flask as part of my INFO3180 course. I enjoy solving problems, building 
            creative projects, and constantly improving my skills. In my free time, I like exploring new 
            programming languages, working on personal projects, and staying up to date with the latest tech 
            trends. I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to growing as a developer!
